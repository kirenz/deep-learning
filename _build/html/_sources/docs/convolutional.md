# Convolutional

In part three of Machine Learning Zero to Hero, AI Advocate Laurence Moroney discusses convolutional neural networks and why they are so powerful in Computer vision scenarios. 

A convolution is a filter that passes over an image, processes it, and extracts features that show a commonality in the image. In the video below you'll see how they work, by processing an image to see if you can extract features from it.
