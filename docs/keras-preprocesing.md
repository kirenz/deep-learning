# Preprocessing layers

Keras input processing pipelines can be used as independent preprocessing code in non-Keras workflows, combined directly with Keras models, and exported as part of a Keras SavedModel.

Keras preprocessing layers can handle a wide range of input, including structured data, images, and text.

With Keras preprocessing layers, you can build and export models that are truly end-to-end: 

- models that accept raw images or raw structured data as input
- models that handle feature normalization or feature value indexing on their own.
