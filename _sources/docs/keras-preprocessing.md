# Preprocessing Layers

Keras Preprocessing Layers are a set of Keras layers aimed at making preprocessing data fit more naturally into model development workflows. They can handle a wide range of input, including structured data, images, and text and can be combined directly with Keras models and exported as part of a Keras SavedModel.

:::{Note}
Keras input processing pipelines can also be used as independent preprocessing code in non-Keras workflows
:::

With Keras preprocessing layers, you can build and export models that are truly end-to-end: 

- models that accept raw images or raw structured data as input
- models that handle feature normalization or feature value indexing on their own.

To learn more about Keras Preprocessing layers, review the videos in the following sections.

## Quick introduction

Check out this quick introduction to machine learning data processing as well as its challenges.

Learn how to easily prepare your data using the new Keras Preprocessing Layers API – in particular, how to do asynchronous preprocessing as part of your data pipeline, and how to export an end-to-end model that embeds its own preprocessing logic:
