# Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an open-source & platform provider of machine learning technologies. Here you can find what you need to get started with different kinds of Machine Learning tasks: demos, use cases, models, datasets, and more.

In particular, Hugging Face provides pretrained models which can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you time from training a model from scratch. The models can be used across different modalities such as:

üìù Text: text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation in over 100 languages.

üñºÔ∏è Images: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

üó£Ô∏è Audio: speech recognition and audio classification.

üêô Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.
